  <h1>Rates &amp; FAQ</h1>

  <h3>Rates</h3>
  <p>Hourly rate for WebMK web development standard updates is $85/hr ($40 minimum).</p>
  <p>For campaigns, custom minisites and other projects, project pricing will be discussed based on the outline of your needs.</p>

  <h3>Turnaround</h3>
  <p>Turnaround for regular web updates is generally within 3 business days. For minisites, campaign and other larger requests, an initial draft will generally be presented within 7 business days. Inquire for exact specifics on larger campaigns.</p>

  <p>Rush turnaround is sometimes available upon request for an additional $25 per hour.</p>

  <h3>Retainer</h3>
  <p>For projects and campaigns a retainer of 40% of the provided quote is required.</p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>To get started, the first step is add me mk@webmk.co as a new user to your ChabadOne Sites account. You can do that by logging in to ChabadOne and navigating to Sites > Admin > User Accounts. You will then see an option to add a new user. (While any access level is fine, granting "Full" Access is the only way to make use of the "Event Registration App", deal with and debug and form issues that arise, and other related concerns).
    </p>

  <h3>Questions?</h3>
  <p>Feel free to email contact@webmk.co. (Yes! .co, not .com ðŸ˜‰)</p>
