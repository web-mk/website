      <strong>Contact for Quote</strong>: Shoot me an email at 'mk@webmk.co' with a general outline of what you're looking for. Please include any designed materials (e.g. Gala Dinner invite) along with your email. After receiving your request expect a response with a quote shortly. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retainer</strong>: Once a quote is generated, you can expect to receive an invoice for the retainer. Please remit retainer payment via one of the available payment options listed in the invoice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grant Access:</strong> Add 'mk@webmk.co' as a new user to your ChabadOne Sites account. You can do that by logging in to ChabadOne and navigating to Sites > Admin > User Accounts. You will then see an option to add a new user. (While any access level is fine, granting "Fodl" Access is the only way to make use of the "Event Registration App", deal with and debug and form issues that arise, and other related concerns).
