  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact for Quote</strong>: Shoot me an email at 'mk@webmk.co' with a general outline of what you're looking for. Feel free to peruse some of the past building campaign sites to get a feeling for what you're looking for, or what may best suit your needs. If you have a building brochure you created for your campaign, please include that along with the email as well. After receiving your request expect a response with a quote shortly. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Retainer</strong>: Once a quote is generated, you can expect to receive an invoice for the retainer. Please remit retainer payment via one of the available payment options listed in the invoice.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grant Access:</strong> Add 'mk@webmk.co' as a new user to your ChabadOne Sites account. You can do that by logging in to ChabadOne and navigating to Sites > Admin > User Accounts. You will then see an option to add a new user. (While any access level is fine, granting "Fodl" Access is the only way to make use of the "Event Registration App", deal with and debug and form issues that arise, and other related concerns).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Questions?</h3>
  <p>Feel free to email contact@webmk.co. (Yes! .co, not .com ðŸ˜‰)</p>
  <p>Email is the primary mode of communication. An online conference call may be scheduled as necessary.</p>
